# Event-Driven Backtest Environment for Algorithms in C++

Large project that will most likely take the entire summer, if not longer. Along the way I plan to pick up C++ as it is the fastest language for event-driven backtesting and is a great tool to have mastery of. 

The plan is to create a MySQL database with daily price information downloaded from Yahoo finance. However, I will eventually need to expand to tick-based data which will require a large amount of storage space, as described by Michael Halls-Moore. Still working out how to do this, and so I will most likely need to put some capital into reserving server space. After parsing and formatting the database, I will create an event-driven updating backtest environement in C++ that has almost the exact same code for backtesting as it does for live trading.

I will eventually set up a blog for this as well, because this will by no means be a one-month project and will act mostly as a learning experience.
