# Event-Driven Backtest Environment for Algorithms in C++

Large project that will most likely take the entire summer, if not longer. Along the way I plan to pick up C++ as it is the fastest language for event-driven backtesting and is a great tool to have mastery of. 

Using my own C+ Yahoo Finance interface to download historical EOD data in .csv file format, which will then be used for backtesting. 

I will eventually set up a blog for this as well, because this will by no means be a one-month project and will act mostly as a learning experience.
